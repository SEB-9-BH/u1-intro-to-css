**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, learners will know how to use CSS to style HTML pages, keeping the website's content separate from its design.

## What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a web technology that formats and styles HTML documents. It also provides stylistic behaviors using CSS animations. CSS controls a web page's layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.

CSS enables us to separate a document's structure & content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS). This concept of separation of concerns is widespread throughout software development. It helps make programs more maintainable and can provide better code reuse.

## Why use CSS?

There are many reasons to use CSS, including:

- **Styling pages:** This one is clear - CSS is how we apply style to web content. It allows brands to apply their signature style to a page. When at its best, it creates memorable user experiences.
- **Consistency:** CSS can create consistent styles across multiple pages on a single site. This creates a professional and polished look and feel.
- **Accessibility:** CSS can make web pages more accessible by presenting information in better ways. It can also draw attention to essential elements. Use caution though; not being thoughtful when applying styles can just as easily render a site inaccessible.
- **Animations, transitions, and more:** CSS offers more advanced features, which can elevate a site's presentation when used sparingly.
